# To-DoApp
I implemented a simple functional To-Do app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to add tasks dynamically, mark them as completed, and remove them when no longer needed. It features a clean user interface, ensuring a smooth user experience. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI design.
